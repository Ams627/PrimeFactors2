# Prime factors problem

Sort a list of integers by two factors

* first by the number of prime factors each integer has
* then by the integer itself

There is at least one integer in the list and at most 10000.
Integers in the list range between 2 and 10000

We use a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes[Sieve of Eratosthenes] but instead of simply marking numbers
as non-prime, we mark them with their lowest prime factor.
